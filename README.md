# FSJS Techdegree Project 10

For this project I had to use React to create a client for an existing school database REST API (that I created in a previous project). The full stack application provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project requires users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.

To complete this project, I had to use my knowledge of React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

After using the Create React App tool to set up my initial project, I had to:

- Use JavaScript and JSX to build out the components for the application in a modular fashion.
- Use React Router to set up the routes.
- Use the Fetch API or a tool like Axios to fetch data from the REST API.
- Allow users to sign up and use basic authentication to support users signing in.
- Add to the supplied CSS to personalize the project.

To further develop the project to recieve an Exceeds Expectations grading, I had to:

- Display user friendly messages - By creating stateless components (`NotFound`, `Forbidden`, `UnhandledError`) and create routes that render them depending on the error.
- Persist user credentials - Using an HTTP cookie so that the user's authenticated state is maintained even if the application is reloaded or loaded into a new browser tab.
- Redirect the user after successfully signing in - Redirect the user's to the previous screen (whatever that happens to be).

Grade: TBC
